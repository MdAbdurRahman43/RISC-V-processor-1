# RISC-V-processor-1
This project implements a single-cycle RISC-V 32-bit processor in Verilog. It supports basic arithmetic, logical, memory, and control operations following the RV32I instruction set.

## Feaatures
✅ Single-cycle execution
✅ Supports RV32I instructions (Load, Store, Arithmetic, Logical, Branch)
✅ Register file with 32 registers (x0–x31)
✅ ALU with ADD, SUB, AND, OR operations
✅ Instruction and Data Memory (256 words each)
✅ Control Unit for instruction decoding
✅ Testbench included for functional verification
## How to Run
### Prerequisites
- Vivado Verilog Simulator
### Simulation Steps
- Clone the repository
- Open the project in your Verilog simulator.
- Load tb_riscv.v as the testbench.
- Run the simulation to verify instruction execution
